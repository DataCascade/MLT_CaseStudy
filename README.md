Predicting The cost of bank's telemarketing campaign
Predicting The cost of bank's telemarketing campaign Explored machine learning techniques to predict the minimum cost of a bank's telemarketing campaign. Utilized a dataset with 41,188 samples and 16 inputs to analyze customer data. Examined attributes including age, job type, marital status, education, credit default, housing loan, personal loan, and previous campaign outcomes. Investigated social and economic context attributes such as employment variation rate, consumer price index, consumer confidence index, euribor 3 month rate, and number of employed citizens. Predicted the target variable "y," indicating whether a client subscribed to a term deposit, using binary classification. Learned about cost savings through machine learning by optimizing marketing campaigns and targeting the right audience effectively. Emphasized the importance of feature selection to improve model performance and provide insights into campaign success factors. Selected appropriate evaluation metrics like ROC AUC for assessing model performance, especially for highly unbalanced datasets. Focused on model interpretation to derive actionable insights and make informed business decisions. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in the marketing campaign data. Compared various classification models to determine the most effective ones for predicting campaign success. Explored how different client attributes influence campaign outcomes, aiding in targeted marketing strategies. Implemented missing value treatment on various variables, with detailed methodologies outlined in the project documentation. Derived insights from the analysis to inform future campaign strategies, potentially leading to improved performance and higher ROI.
